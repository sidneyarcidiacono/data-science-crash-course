# Good Data (for Data Science)

## Getting Started Guide

Okay, I can hear you already "how do I know if I have *good* data?". I'm here to answer your question. The answer, in part, is... I don't know. I don't know what your use case is.

But you know, that's a really unfulfilling answer. So let's try again. While I'll refer you to the [design process]() section to get some practice thinking about your use case and what you'll need to implement it, here are some resources that provide some explanations of what *good data* means for a data scientist.

Before we dive in, here are some rules of thumb I've picked up along the way:

1. Good data is data that is ethically sourced -- that you're authorized to have, that doesn't violate regulations, and that considers your user's privacy and safety.

2. Good data is properly labeled (if implementing supervised learning. This is *most* use cases.)

3. Good data is enough data - especially if you're using neural networks. You want to be sure you have enough data to effectively train your model.

4. Good data considers your problem and is based on evidence -- there is a reason that this data supports the outcome you want to achieve.

Alright, enough about what I think, though.

### Resources:

Bear in mind that a lot of these resources are geared towards business analysis, so take them with a grain of salt. However, I've only chosen resources that share information that's applicable to data science.

After all, although "data science" is a ubiquitous term, it isn't separate from "traditional" business analysis.
