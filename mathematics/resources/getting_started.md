# Mathematics for Data Science

## Getting Started Guide

Okay, so, cool, we know that we need to learn a lot of math to become a data scientist, but where in the h*ll should we start?

I think that right off the bat, something that we should play around with and make sure we understand are the basics of statistics and probability.

Luckily, I've tried my hand at a variety of sites that provide some coursework in these areas.

### Statistics

Have you taken high school stats? If so, you can likely skip the next few linked resources on mean, median, and mode (you know, the basic stuff).

[Statistics Fundamentals](https://brilliant.org)

This one needs a bit of information since I can't easily just share the link. You *will* need to make an account, and Brilliant gives a minimal intro to its courses for free. Still, it's a really fun to use platform that I recommend (even if you just skim the courses to practice). In their "Statistics and Finance" concentration you can take their Statistics Fundamentals course.

[Basic Statistics - Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-sixth-grade-math/cc-6th-data-statistics)

This says "Sixth Grade Math" but don't let your ego get in the way. Practice mean, median and mode to your heart's content and learn about interquartile ranges, box plots, histograms, and more while you're at it. We'll be needing those all later.

[Intro to Statistics - Anywhere Math](https://invidious.tube/watch?v=LMSyiAJm99g)

For those of you who do better with videos, this is a good intro to statistics concepts and "what is statistics"?

I'd follow it up with the next video to get a little deeper:

I'm sure there's more to statistics that I should add later, but if you've gotten through the basics and you're ready for more, check out the next few topics:

[AP Statistics - Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics)

[Intro to Bayesian Statistics](https://invidious.tube/watch?v=0F0QoMCSKJ4)

Bayesian probability is a big thing that we can talk about in the probability section, but this is a good overview of Bayesian Statistics as well.

### Probability

### Linear Algebra

Everyone's favorite subject! Figure out why vectors and matrices are so important, and what their operations represent. You'll be working with these a lot, so it's fun to understand them.

### Calculus

Calculus is a tricky one. While learning more calculus helps you learn the *basic concepts* of calculus, you won't *use* everything for machine learning. In my opinion--and this is something I'm currently striving to learn more myself--more is better.

Someone who's the VP of Data Science at a large company recently told me that they like to see Data Scientists who've taken typical college math courses through multi-variate calculus because of the "maturity around symbols" that you learn over time as you're exposed to these concepts over and over, building on them as you go. I have to feel like this is wise advice, and try to strive for it. The deeper you get into the papers behind many machine learning architectures or algorithms, the more you'll want to become quite familiar with the symbols used to fully understand the concepts introduced.

#### Follow-up and Notes

Some things to keep in mind as you traverse these materials:

1. This is *not* an exhaustive list. Do not stick to this list. While I'm attempting to make this list as exhaustive as possible, I am certainly not a total respository of the mathematics resources available on the internet. I'm sure there are more, and highly encourage you to use this as a starting point to find other materials, or questions you need answered, and to go from there.

2. You don't need to traverse this list linearly or in any specific order, although be honest with yourself when you don't understand something. If a lesson or video brings up a concept that you don't understand, a rule of thumb I use when I learn is:

  - Is this thing I don't understand a *prerequisite* concept or a *satellite* concept? In other words, is it inhibiting my understanding of the larger concept?
  - If it is inhibiting my understanding of the larger concept, it's time to stop and do some more digging.
  - If it isn't, I make a note of it so I can look it up later, and view it as a "black box" for the moment, so I don't lose focus on the current lesson or concept.

3. Learning all of this math is not a prerequisite to playing around with modeling. Some people learn best that way - learning all of the building blocks of *how something works* before getting into the *thing* itself, but some learn better with a top-down approach, *expermenting with something* and finding questions to answer along the way. I'm a blend of both, so I find it important to re-iterate that this isn't really a *course* -- it's mostly a compilation of resources so that you can go learn what you want or need to learn however you want to learn it.
