# Mathematics for Data Science

## Getting Started Guide

Okay, so, cool, we know that we need to learn a lot of math to become a data scientist, but where in the h*ll should we start?

I think that right off the bat, something that we should play around with and make sure we understand are the basics of statistics and probability.

Luckily, I've tried my hand at a variety of sites that provide some coursework in these areas.

### Statistics

Have you taken high school stats? If so, you can likely skip the next few linked resources on mean, median, and mode (you know, the basic stuff).

[Statistics Fundamentals](https://brilliant.org)

This one needs a bit of information since I can't easily just share the link. You *will* need to make an account, and Brilliant gives a minimal intro to its courses for free. Still, it's a really fun to use platform that I recommend (even if you just skim the courses to practice). In their "Statistics and Finance" concentration you can take their Statistics Fundamentals course.

[Basic Statistics - Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-sixth-grade-math/cc-6th-data-statistics)

This says "Sixth Grade Math" but don't let your ego get in the way. Practice mean, median and mode to your heart's content and learn about interquartile ranges, box plots, histograms, and more while you're at it. We'll be needing those all later.

[Intro to Statistics - Anywhere Math](https://invidious.tube/watch?v=LMSyiAJm99g)

For those of you who do better with videos, this is a good intro to statistics concepts and "what is statistics"?

I'd follow it up with the next video to get a little deeper:

I'm sure there's more to statistics that I should add later, but if you've gotten through the basics and you're ready for more, check out the next few topics:

[AP Statistics - Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics)

[Intro to Bayesian Statistics](https://invidious.tube/watch?v=0F0QoMCSKJ4)

Bayesian probability is a big thing that we can talk about in the probability section, but this is a good overview of Bayesian Statistics as well.

### Probability
